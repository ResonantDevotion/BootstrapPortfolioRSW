# BootstrapPortfolioRSW
This is a personal portfolio built predominantly using bootstrap.


## Description 

This portfolio was made to showcase my skills and talents (specifically using bootstrap in this case) to potential employers. I built this portfolio to practice and build up my bootstrap, HTML, and CSS skills, in a tangible way. This portfolio should stand out as the content is personal to me but has also been made by my subjective eye.


Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
