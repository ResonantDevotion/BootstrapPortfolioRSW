# BootstrapPortfolioRSW
This is a personal portfolio built predominantly using bootstrap.


## Description 

This portfolio was made to showcase my skills and talents (specifically using bootstrap in this case) to potential employers. I built this portfolio to practice and build up my bootstrap, HTML, and CSS skills, in a tangible way. This portfolio should stand out as the content is personal to me but has also been made by my subjective eye.
